# Syntopicon Taxonomy Guide

## Overview
This taxonomy is based on Mortimer Adler's Syntopicon - the index of Great Ideas from the Great Books of the Western World. It serves as the primary concept taxonomy for tagging chunks in the community library.

## Purpose
Enable users to discover content across different sources by mapping chunks to universal concepts that appear throughout Western philosophical and theological literature.

---

## Structure

### Top-Level: 102 Great Ideas (CONSTRAINED)
The 102 concepts from Adler's Syntopicon form the complete and closed list of top-level concepts.

**CRITICAL**: AI enrichment systems MUST NOT add new top-level concepts. These 102 are authoritative and comprehensive.

### Second-Level: Topics (FLEXIBLE)
Each of the 102 concepts has 8-15 **topics** that:
- Serve as **concept handles** - sticky, memorable, searchable terms
- Provide granular filtering and discovery
- Use modern, recognizable terminology from philosophy, theology, and apologetics
- Are inspired by Adler's topic outlines but expressed as **named concepts** rather than abstract categories
- Can be extended by AI during enrichment when clearly relevant

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Honor the Tradition
- Keep all 102 of Adler's Great Ideas without modification
- Respect the decades of scholarship that went into creating this taxonomy
- Maintain compatibility with existing Syntopicon references
- Use Adler's outlines as scope guides, not as literal topic sources

### 2. Concept Handles, Not Abstract Categories
Topics should be **sticky, memorable, and searchable** - not generic abstractions.

#### ✅ GOOD Topics (Concept Handles)
- **"Chronological Snobbery"** (C.S. Lewis) - assuming newer is better
- **"Via Pulchritudinis"** - the way of beauty
- **"Eucatastrophe"** (Tolkien) - sudden joyous turn
- **"Map and Territory"** (Korzybski) - representation vs. reality
- **"Overton Window"** - range of acceptable discourse
- **"Christian Hedonism"** (John Piper) - God's glory and our joy
- **"The Sublime"** - beauty that overwhelms
- **"Beauty Will Save the World"** (Dostoevsky)

#### ❌ BAD Topics (Too Abstract)
- "Nature of Beauty"
- "Beauty and Truth"
- "Aesthetic Experience"
- "General Theory"
- "Relationship Between X and Y"

### 3. Sources for Topics
Draw from multiple traditions and levels:
- **Classical philosophy** - Aristotelian/Thomistic terms that are still widely used
- **Christian theology** - Patristic, Medieval, Reformed terminology
- **Apologetics writers** - C.S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton, N.T. Wright, Tim Keller
- **Modern frameworks** - Popular concepts from contemporary discourse
- **Literary/cultural phrases** - Recognizable metaphors and allusions
- **Named concepts** - Terms associated with specific thinkers
- **Technical terms** - But ONLY if widely used and recognizable

### 4. Domain Relevance
Topics should be recognizable to readers of Christian apologetics, philosophy, and theology:
- Include common variations (e.g., both "Satan" and "Lucifer")
- Focus on concepts that actually appear in the literature being indexed
- Prioritize terms people will actually search for
- Use language from both scholarly and popular discourse

### 5. Balanced Granularity
- Aim for **8-15 topics** per Great Idea
- Enough detail for meaningful filtering
- Not so many that it becomes unwieldy
- Mix broad concepts with specific named ideas
- Remember: the list can grow over time

## AI Enrichment Rules

### When Tagging Chunks

**Step 1: Match to Top-Level Concept (Required)**
- AI must map chunk to one of the 102 Great Ideas
- Use 1-3 concepts per chunk maximum
- NEVER create new top-level concepts

**Step 2: Match to Topic (Preferred)**
- First, try to match to existing topics
- If no good match exists, AI may add a new topic IF:
  - The concept is clearly discussed in the chunk
  - It falls within the scope of the Great Idea (as defined by Adler's outline)
  - It uses recognizable terminology from philosophy/theology/apologetics
  - It would be a useful, memorable concept handle for filtering/discovery
  - It's something people would actually search for

**Step 3: Confidence Score**
- Rate confidence in the concept mapping (0.6-1.0)
- Only tag if confidence ≥ 0.6

### Example Tagging Process

**Chunk text**: "Tolkien's concept of eucatastrophe - the sudden joyous turn that brings tears of joy - reflects the Christian story where the crucifixion leads to resurrection. This aesthetic principle shows how beauty can emerge from apparent tragedy."

**Tagging**:
```json
{
  "syntopicon_tags": [
    {
      "concept": "Beauty",
      "topic": "Eucatastrophe",
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    {
      "concept": "Beauty",
      "topic": "The Beautiful Death",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

**If topic doesn't exist**: Chunk discusses "beauty as healing" but that's not in the topic list.
- ✅ AI can add "Beauty as Healing" as a new topic under Beauty
- ✅ Falls within the scope of Beauty (aesthetic experience, redemption)
- ✅ Uses recognizable language
- ❌ AI cannot create a new top-level "Healing" concept

---

## Model Concept: Beauty

This demonstrates the new structure and topic style:

```json
{
  "id": "beauty",
  "name": "Beauty",
  "domains": ["transcendental", "ethics", "subjects"],
  "description": "The nature of beauty and aesthetic experience; the relationship of beauty to truth and goodness; beauty in art, nature, and human experience; aesthetic judgment and standards",
  "topics": [
    "Via Pulchritudinis",           // The way of beauty (theological)
    "The Sublime",                   // Overwhelming beauty (philosophical)
    "Splendor of Form",             // Thomistic aesthetics
    "Beauty as Pointer",            // Beauty pointing beyond itself
    "Aesthetic Arrest",             // Joyce's moment of apprehension
    "The Beautiful Death",          // Paradox of beauty in suffering
    "Eucatastrophe",               // Tolkien's joyous turn
    "Transcendentals",             // Beauty/Truth/Goodness unity
    "Disinterested Delight",       // Kant's aesthetic pleasure
    "Beauty and the Beast",        // Beauty redeeming brokenness
    "Incarnational Aesthetics",    // Beauty rooted in creation
    "The Useless Beauty",          // Beauty for its own sake
    "Philokalia",                  // Love of beauty (Eastern)
    "Beauty Will Save the World"   // Dostoevsky's vision
  ],
  "adler_outline_scope": {
    "includes": [
      "The nature of beauty as a transcendental property",
      "Beauty as objective vs. subjective",
      "The relationship between beauty, truth, and goodness",
      "Beauty as a source of pleasure and delight",
      "Aesthetic experience and contemplation",
      "Beauty in the fine arts and artistic creation",
      "Natural beauty in the created world",
      "Beauty as a sign of divine perfection",
      "Aesthetic judgment and taste",
      "Standards and criteria of beauty",
      "Beauty and the good life",
      "Beauty as an object of love and desire",
      "The role of beauty in education and formation",
      "Beauty and moral character",
      "Beauty in religious and theological context"
    ],
    "excludes": [
      "Technical artistic skill (see ART)",
      "Pure sensory pleasure (see PLEASURE AND PAIN)",
      "Mathematical beauty (see MATHEMATICS)",
      "Natural science aesthetics (see SCIENCE)"
    ]
  },
  "note": "Topics derived from Adler's outline but expressed as concept handles - sticky, memorable, searchable terms"
}
```

**"Eucatastrophe"** - Tolkien's sudden joyous turn
- ✅ Memorable coined term
- ✅ Associated with specific thinker
- ✅ Captures complex aesthetic/theological idea

**"Beauty Will Save the World"** - Dostoevsky's vision
- ✅ Famous quotation
- ✅ Carries rich meaning
- ✅ Recognizable across disciplines

**"The Sublime"** - Overwhelming beauty
- ✅ Standard philosophical term
- ✅ Still widely used
- ✅ Distinct from generic "beauty"

## Domains

Concepts are organized into 8 domains (from Adler's topical organization):

1. **Transcendental** - Beauty, Being, Good & Evil, Same & Other, Truth
2. **Ethics** - Virtue & Vice, Justice, Duty, Courage, etc.
3. **Politics** - Democracy, State, Constitution, Liberty, etc.
4. **Liberal Arts** - Logic, Rhetoric, Dialectic, Language, etc.
5. **Metaphysics** - God, Angel, Being, Cause, Nature, etc.
6. **Anthropology & Psychology** - Man, Soul, Mind, Will, Knowledge, etc.
7. **Physics** - Space, Time, Matter, Cause, Nature, etc.
8. **Subjects** - Philosophy, Theology, Science, Art, etc.

**Note**: Many concepts appear in multiple domains (e.g., "Being" in Transcendental, Ethics, and Metaphysics). This is intentional and reflects the interdisciplinary nature of great ideas.

## Usage in Community Library

### For Content Creators
When preparing community library sources, you manually tag based on this taxonomy or use AI enrichment with these guidelines.

### For Users
Search and filter by:
- **Concept only**: "Show me all chunks about Beauty"
- **Concept + topic**: "Show me chunks about Eucatastrophe"
- **Domain**: "Show me all Transcendental concepts"
- **Cross-concept**: "Show me chunks that discuss both Beauty and Truth"
- **Named concepts**: "Show me everything tagged with C.S. Lewis concepts"

### For AI Enrichment (Claude)
When enriching chunks:
1. Identify 1-3 concepts from the 102 Great Ideas
2. Match to existing topics when possible
3. Add new topics when they're memorable, searchable concept handles
4. Never add new top-level concepts
5. Rate confidence in mappings
6. Prioritize sticky, recognizable terminology

## Version

**Current**: v2.0 (Topics as Concept Handles)  
**Status**: In development - creating topics for all 102 concepts  
**Model**: Beauty demonstrates the new approach

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete topics for all 102 concepts using the concept handles approach
2. Validate with sample tagging on real chunks
3. Build cross-reference database linking related topics
4. Create glossary defining each topic/concept handle
5. Test and refine based on actual usage
6. Develop "named concepts" index (e.g., all C.S. Lewis concepts across Great Ideas)

---

## Remember

**Topics are CONCEPT HANDLES** - they should be:
- ✅ **Sticky** - Memorable and quotable
- ✅ **Searchable** - Terms people actually use
- ✅ **Textured** - Rich with connotations
- ✅ **Named** - Associated with thinkers when possible
- ✅ **Actionable** - Useful for real content tagging

Not abstract categories like "Nature of X" or "X and Y Relationship"!
