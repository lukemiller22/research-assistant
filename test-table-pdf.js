Chapter 3: Research Results

The following table shows the experimental results from our study:

Table 1: Performance Metrics
┌─────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ Algorithm   │ Accuracy │ Precision│ Recall   │
├─────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ Random Forest│ 0.85    │ 0.82     │ 0.88     │
│ SVM         │ 0.78    │ 0.75     │ 0.81     │
│ Neural Net  │ 0.92    │ 0.89     │ 0.94     │
└─────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘

As we can see from Table 1, the Neural Network algorithm performed best across all metrics. The accuracy of 0.92 represents a significant improvement over traditional methods.

Figure 1: [Image of a bar chart showing the same data]

The bar chart in Figure 1 visually confirms these findings. The neural network's superior performance can be attributed to its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

Conclusion: Based on these results, we recommend using neural networks for this type of classification task.
